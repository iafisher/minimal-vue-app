Minimal example of a Vue app with single-file components using NPM and Webpack, without all the bells and whistles that the Vue CLI adds. Produces a bundled JavaScript file suitable for use in an existing web application.

```
git clone https://github.com/iafisher/minimal-vue-app.git
cd minimal-vue-app
npm install
npm run build
```

Then open `index.html` in a browser.
